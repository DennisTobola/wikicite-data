# WikiCite data

This repository contains scripts to extract, transform, and analyze bibliographic data from Wikidata.

## Overview

Bibliographic data can be extracted from Wikidata dumps which are provided weekly at <https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/> as documented at <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Database_download>. Old JSON dumps are archived at Internet Archive starting from October 2014. Then Wikidata JSON dump format was introduced in July 2014 so data from between February 2013 until would require additional preprocessing.

Processing Wikidata dumps requires storage, processing time, and knowledge. With the scripts in this repository, Wikidata dumps can be pre-processed and provided in simplified form, more suitable for use of bibliographic data from Wikidata.


## Requirements

The current scripts require the following technologies:

* standard Unix command line tools (`bash`, `make`, `wget`)
* compression tools (`gzip`, `bzip2`)
* node >= 6.4.0 and npm
    * npm packages as listed in `packages.json`
* jq

## Usage

### Download dumps

The `download-dump` script can be used to download a full, compressed JSON dump from <https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/> and place it in a subdirectory named by date of the dump:

    ./download-dump 20170626

A MD5 hash of the extracted dump can be computed like this:

    make 20170626/wikidata-20170626-all.md5

The MD5 hash is commited in git for reference.

## Extract publication classes

To find out which Wikidata items refer to bibliographic objects, we must extract all subclasses of [Q732577](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q732577) (publication). The class hierarchy must be derived from the JSON dump because it will likely have been changed in meantime.

First extract all truthy subclass-of statements:

    make 20170626/wikidata-20170626-all.classes.csv

Then get all subclasses of Q732577:

    make 20170626/wikidata-20170626-all.pubtypes

The list of publication types is sorted and commited for reference.

## Extract bibliographic items

All bibliographic items, with simplified truthy statements:

    make 20170626/wikidata-20170626-all.wikicite.ndjson.bz2

Claims with special value "unknown" are not included by now!

## Extract labels

The wikicite dump does not contain information about non-bibliographic items such as people and places. To further make use of the data you likely need labels.

    make 20170626/wikidata-20170626-all.labels.ndjson

Uncompressed label files tend do get large so compression or reduction to a selected language may be added later.

## Convert to other bibliographic formats

To be done (especially CSL-JSON and MARCXML)
